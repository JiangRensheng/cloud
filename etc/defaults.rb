# Rackspace Cloud Configuration
#
# To use RAX provider, you must manually create a CentOS 6 based image which allows sudo without a tty. To do this:
#  1. Spin up a server based on the "CentOS 6 (PVHVM)" image via the Rackspace Cloud UI
#  2. SSH into the box and run the following command:
#     $ sed -i.bk -e 's/^\(Defaults\s\+requiretty\)/# \1/' /etc/sudoers
#  3. Logout of the box and create an image named "CentOS 6 Base Image" via the Rackspace Cloud UI
